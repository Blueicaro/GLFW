# GLFW
Headers of  GLFW for FreePascal and Lazarus
Here you can find Headers for Free Pascal / Lazarus files to use GLFW.
The orignal proyect is here:
http://www.glfw.org/

This descriptions is taken from the orginal web:

GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL,
OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop.
It provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.
GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, OS X and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, 
such as Linux and FreeBSD.

## Update 220417
I updated the struct of files. Now all files are called glfw.pas. Every version has a folder. For example in folder GLFW31, you will
find the source for 3.1 version.

Also I updated the headers to match the version of headers to the last revision, 3.3.7
