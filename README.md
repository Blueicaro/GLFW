### What is GLFW?

*(The following description is sourced from the official GLFW website:)*

**GLFW** is an **Open Source, multi-platform library** designed for OpenGL, OpenGL ES, and Vulkan development on the desktop. It offers a simple API for creating windows, contexts, and surfaces, as well as for receiving input and events.

GLFW is written in **C** and provides native support for **Windows, macOS,** and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as **Linux** and **FreeBSD.**
