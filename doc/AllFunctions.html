<p>Creates a new custom cursor image that can be set for a window with ref glfwSetCursor. The cursor can be destroyed with ref glfwDestroyCursor. Any remaining cursors are destroyed by ref glfwTerminate.

<p>The pixels are 32-bit, little-endian, non-premultiplied RGBA, i.e. eight bits per channel with the red channel first. They are arranged canonically as packed sequential rows, starting from the top-left corner.

<p>The cursor hotspot is specified in pixels, relative to the upper-left corner of the cursor image. Like all other coordinate systems in GLFW, the X-axis points to the right and the Y-axis points down.

<p>param[in] image The desired cursor image. param[in] xhot The desired x-coordinate, in pixels, of the cursor hotspot. param[in] yhot The desired y-coordinate, in pixels, of the cursor hotspot. return The handle of the created cursor, or `NULL` if an [error](ref error_handling) occurred.

<td class="itemunit"><a class="bold" href="glfw.html">glfw</a></td>
<td class="itemdesc"><p>/! brief Creates a window and its associated context.

<p>This function creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES context. Most of the options controlling how the window and its context should be created are specified with [window hints](ref window_hints).

<p>Successful creation does not change which context is current. Before you can use the newly created context, you need to [make it current](ref context_current). For information about the `share` parameter, see ref context_sharing.

<p>The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you requested, as not all parameters and hints are [hard constraints](ref window_hints_hard). This includes the size of the window, especially for full screen windows. To query the actual attributes of the created window, framebuffer and context, see ref glfwGetWindowAttrib, ref glfwGetWindowSize and ref glfwGetFramebufferSize.

<p>To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window will cover. If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode. Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is recommended that you pick the primary monitor. For more information on how to query connected monitors, see ref monitor_monitors.

<p>For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the window's _desired video mode_. As long as a full screen window is not iconified, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video mode is set for the specified monitor. For more information about full screen windows, including the creation of so called _windowed full screen_ or _borderless full screen_ windows, see ref window_windowed_full_screen.

<p>Once you have created the window, you can switch it between windowed and full screen mode with ref glfwSetWindowMonitor. This will not affect its OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.

<p>By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the window system. To create the window at a specific position, make it initially invisible using the [GLFW_VISIBLE](ref GLFW_VISIBLE_hint) window hint, set its [position](ref window_pos) and then [show](ref window_hide) it.

<p>As long as at least one full screen window is not iconified, the screensaver is prohibited from starting.

<p>Window systems put limits on window sizes. Very large or very small window dimensions may be overridden by the window system on creation. Check the actual [size](ref window_size) after creation.

<p>The [swap interval](ref buffer_swap) is not set during window creation and the initial value may vary depending on driver settings and defaults.

<p>param[in] width The desired width, in screen coordinates, of the window. This must be greater than zero. param[in] height The desired height, in screen coordinates, of the window. This must be greater than zero. param[in] title The initial, UTF-8 encoded window title. param[in] monitor The monitor to use for full screen mode, or `NULL` for windowed mode. param[in] share The window whose context to share resources with, or `NULL` to not share resources. return The handle of the created window, or `NULL` if an [error](ref error_handling) occurred.

<p>errors Possible errors include ref GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, ref GLFW_INVALID_ENUM, ref GLFW_INVALID_VALUE, ref GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE, ref GLFW_VERSION_UNAVAILABLE, ref GLFW_FORMAT_UNAVAILABLE and ref GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.

<p>remark win32 Window creation will fail if the Microsoft GDI software OpenGL implementation is the only one available.

<p>remark win32 If the executable has an icon resource named `GLFW_ICON,` it will be set as the initial icon for the window. If no such icon is present, the `IDI_APPLICATION` icon will be used instead. To set a different icon, see ref glfwSetWindowIcon.

<p>remark win32 The context to share resources with must not be current on any other thread.

<p>remark macos The OS only supports forward-compatible core profile contexts for OpenGL versions 3.2 and later. Before creating an OpenGL context of version 3.2 or later you must set the [GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT](ref GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT_hint) and [GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE](ref GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE_hint) hints accordingly. OpenGL 3.0 and 3.1 contexts are not supported at all on macOS.

<p>remark macos The GLFW window has no icon, as it is not a document window, but the dock icon will be the same as the application bundle's icon. For more information on bundles, see the [Bundle Programming Guide](<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/</a>) in the Mac Developer Library.

<p>remark macos The first time a window is created the menu bar is created. If GLFW finds a `MainMenu.nib` it is loaded and assumed to contain a menu bar. Otherwise a minimal menu bar is created manually with common commands like Hide, Quit and About. The About entry opens a minimal about dialog with information from the application's bundle. Menu bar creation can be disabled entirely with the ref GLFW_COCOA_MENUBAR init hint.

<p>remark macos On OS X 10.10 and later the window frame will not be rendered at full resolution on Retina displays unless the [GLFW_COCOA_RETINA_FRAMEBUFFER](ref GLFW_COCOA_RETINA_FRAMEBUFFER_hint) hint is `GLFW_TRUE` and the `NSHighResolutionCapable` key is enabled in the application bundle's `Info.plist`. For more information, see [High Resolution Guidelines for OS X](<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Explained/Explained.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Explained/Explained.html</a>) in the Mac Developer Library. The GLFW test and example programs use a custom `Info.plist` template for this, which can be found as `CMake/MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in` in the source tree.

<p>remark macos When activating frame autosaving with [GLFW_COCOA_FRAME_NAME](ref GLFW_COCOA_FRAME_NAME_hint), the specified window size and position may be overridden by previously saved values.

<p>remark x11 Some window managers will not respect the placement of initially hidden windows.

<p>remark x11 Due to the asynchronous nature of X11, it may take a moment for a window to reach its requested state. This means you may not be able to query the final size, position or other attributes directly after window creation.

<p>remark x11 The class part of the `WM_CLASS` window property will by default be set to the window title passed to this function. The instance part will use the contents of the `RESOURCE_NAME` environment variable, if present and not empty, or fall back to the window title. Set the [GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME](ref GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME_hint) and [GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME](ref GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME_hint) window hints to override this.

<p>remark wayland Compositors should implement the xdg-decoration protocol for GLFW to decorate the window properly. If this protocol isn't supported, or if the compositor prefers client-side decorations, a very simple fallback frame will be drawn using the wp_viewporter protocol. A compositor can still emit close, maximize or fullscreen events, using for instance a keybind mechanism. If neither of these protocols is supported, the window won't be decorated.

<p>remark wayland A full screen window will not attempt to change the mode, no matter what the requested size or refresh rate.

<p>remark wayland Screensaver inhibition requires the idle-inhibit protocol to be implemented in the user's compositor.

<p>If the specified joystick is not present this function will return `NULL` but will not generate an error. This can be used instead of first calling ref glfwJoystickPresent.

<p>The GUID uses the format introduced in SDL 2.0.5. This GUID tries to uniquely identify the make and model of a joystick but does not identify a specific unit, e.g. all wired Xbox 360 controllers will have the same GUID on that platform. The GUID for a unit may vary between platforms depending on what hardware information the platform specific APIs provide.

<p>param[in] jid The [joystick](ref joysticks) to query. return The UTF-8 encoded GUID of the joystick, or `NULL` if the joystick is not present or an [error](ref error_handling) occurred.

<p>If the mode is `GLFW_CURSOR`, the value must be one of the following cursor modes: - `GLFW_CURSOR_NORMAL` makes the cursor visible and behaving normally. - `GLFW_CURSOR_HIDDEN` makes the cursor invisible when it is over the content area of the window but does not restrict the cursor from leaving. - `GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED` hides and grabs the cursor, providing virtual and unlimited cursor movement. This is useful for implementing for example 3D camera controls.

<p>If the mode is `GLFW_STICKY_KEYS`, the value must be either `GLFW_TRUE` to enable sticky keys, or `GLFW_FALSE` to disable it.

If sticky mouse buttons are enabled, a mouse button press will ensure that ref glfwGetMouseButton returns `GLFW_PRESS` the next time it is called even if the mouse button had been released before the call.

<p>errors Possible errors include ref GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED and ref GLFW_INVALID_ENUM.
